# Simple Node.js and Angular.js Example

This is a simple example application developed using Angular.js as frontend and Node.js as backend.

## Installation

Open up your command line or console and run the following 2 commands:
```
> node -v
> npm -v
```
If either of these commands go unrecognized, go to Nodejs.org and download the appropriate installer and install it

Once finished, close and reload console and re-run the above commands. They should now provide you with version numbers.

```
> git clone https://github.com/abidaks/angularjs-nodejs-example
```

## Running
Now you can run it using the node command

```
> node app
```

## Future Updates
This is a simple application without database connection, i will connect the application to various databases (NoSQL or regular SQL).
