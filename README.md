This is a simple example e-commerce application is developed using Angular.js as frontend and Node.js as backend.

Currently developing backend of the application, once it completes i will create frontend store.

## Installation

Open up your command line or console and run the following 2 commands:
```
> node -v
> npm -v
```
If either of these commands go unrecognized, go to Nodejs.org and download the appropriate installer and install it

Once finished, close and reload console and re-run the above commands. They should now provide you with version numbers.
